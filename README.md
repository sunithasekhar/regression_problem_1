### regression_problem_1 ###

In this problem, the task is to predict the current health of an organism (as given by the target variable). Given the measurements from two biological sensors
measuring their bio-markers (negative indicates that it is lesser than the average case). With this data, you are expected to try our linear regression
models on the training data and report the following metrics on the test split: **(a) Mean Squared Error**, and **(b) Mean Absolute Error**.
The dataset contains CSV files with 2 feature columns, the third column being the target values.
**Support vector regression** and **linear regression** methods are used in modeling.
